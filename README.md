We used a simple wrapper to feed the necesary information into pipeline.sh:

	$1 = the path to the forward read fastq file
	$2 = the path to the reverse read fastq file
	$3 = the path to the barcode file with the following format:
		"Sample name"	"forward barcode"	"reverse barcode"	"20bp around cutsite"	"Experiment"
	$4 = the path to the reference sequence, with the format:
		"Experiment name"	"reference sequence"
	$5 = The name of the experiment, for file naming purposes


You'll need to download:
1) PEAR, to pair Paired End Illumina reads: https://sco.h-its.org/exelixis/web/software/pear/

And then compile:

2) Mapp, an optimal sequence alignment used in Perli et al, 2016. The C++ code is available at: http://www.rle.mit.edu/sbg/resources/stgRNA/
